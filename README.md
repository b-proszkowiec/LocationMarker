# Pecki (Android location marker)
Use your phone to walk around the perimeter of a selected area and mark its edges directly on the map. The application allows you to save the resulting shape locally on your device. Once the polygon is created, you can access detailed information about it â€” including the length of its sides, total perimeter, and the surface area it covers. This feature is especially useful for mapping forest compartments, plots of land, or any irregular terrain boundaries with precision and ease.
